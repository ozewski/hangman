# Hangman

A simple game allowing the user to guess characters towards a mystery word. A "hangman" visual is shown on the screen which gains body parts as the user accumulates incorrect guesses.

The user can pick from easy mode (<5 letters) and hard mode (>5 letters). All words are nouns and are sourced from https://eslgrammar.org/list-of-nouns/.

This project was built in Python and can be run on all platforms.

To run, clone the repo and run `python3 main.py`.
